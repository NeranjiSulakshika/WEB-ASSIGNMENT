<h1 style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Bedrooms</h1>
<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Our superior room has a comforting, homely air. Stay here, and youâ€™ll find enough room to relax and reflect at the same time. While the comfortable bed will keep luring you into laziness, the work desk might compel you to squeeze in some time for work. Serving as a pleasing background, familiar views of the constantly humming cityscape and a drowning sun that creates beautiful silhouettes of the surroundings, will take over your heart.</p>
