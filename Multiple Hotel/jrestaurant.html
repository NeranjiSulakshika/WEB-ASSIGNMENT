<h1 style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Restaurant</h1>
<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;">Sit among a sophisticated blend of traditional and contemporary architecture, as you dine on Jaffna specialties ranging from its famous crab curry, to the characteristic Odiyal Kool (a seafood broth). With a history of South Indian influences in the region, our main restaurant – “Peninsula” also serves a selection of culinary delights from our neighbour across the Palk Strait, accompanied by fresh produce from the very peninsula seen through the large windows around you.</p>
